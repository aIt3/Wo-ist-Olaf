      <h1>Where is Olaf?</h1>
      <p>
        Food prices are rising, the climate crisis is causing dry rivers and failing harvests. Thankfully, Germany has a social democratic chancellor who is willing to tackle these problems. Unfortunately, he has just made himself a bit rare in the last days, try to talk to him in the corridors of the Chancellor's Office.
